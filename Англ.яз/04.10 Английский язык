Main idea , points

Constructor management is a professional service that provides a project owners.
Main idea that CM can most effective provides project.
Firstly, CM are uniquely qualified through combined education and experience to work with other personal.
Secondly, for example in 2013 constructor management saved money, avoided problems and produced higher quality.
Thirdly, CM represent owners interest and provides oversight over the entire project directly for the owner.
In general, professional CM use industry-standard practice to manage projects successfully.





Summary about Construction management.docx

This article "Construction management" states that CM can most effectively provide a project.(not link, only author ,year)
It is argued that CM is a professional service that provide a project owner with effective management of the project schedule, cost, quality, safety, scope and function.
The CM represent the owner interest and provide over sight over the entire project directly for the owner.
Article also support the view that professional CM use industry-standard practice to manage project successfully.
Overall, the CM body of knowledge and standards of practice address all six areas of construction management service: schedule, cost, safety, quality, function, and scope.


Questions:
	What are the core benefits of the construction management, according to the text?
The core benefits of the construction management it is save money, avoided or mitigated problems and produced higher quality result.
	Which would you add?

	Would you like to hold a position of a construction manager? Why? Why not?



My summary:

Matskina, Petrochenko, Radaev in their article, "Stochastic model of the construction process implemented with application of sliding formwork" argues that the parameters of technological processes based on different factors of stochastic nature have significant influence on the duration and cost of the works performed in accordance with construction.
The article states that based on the analysis, the following conclusions were made:
Firstly, sliding formwork is main advantages - relatively high speed of work and the tightness of the finished structure and disadvantages - increase of operational costs, impact on the accuracy of formwork positioning on the quality of the work performed.
Secondly, researchers have formulated the practical recommendations connected to the formwork occupancy and than in condition of layer-by-layer casting it is much easier to control thermal cracking.
Thirdly, most of existing scientific developments are based on a deterministic, not stochastic, nature of the parameters of construction process implemented with application of sliding formwork and therefore dont correspond to the real conditions of technological process.
In general description of the article can been formulated in terms of the following elements: first is Creation of the stochastic model implemented with application of sliding formwork. second is implementation of the stochastic model on a practical example for objective estimation of the practical significance of the created model.
