Topic of my presentation is
The impact of tunnel construction on the environment.
A
(слайд 2)
The object of research are traffic tunnels at the combined road. The construction and exploitation of roads has had a negative impact on the environment.
At  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century,  the  volume  of  traffic  tunnels  construction  in  Russia  has  increased  manyfold.
In  accordance  with  the  existing  regulations,  anthropogenic  impact  in  any area  is  permissible  provided  that  it  does  not  incur  a  long term  disruption  of  the  environment  that  would  spread  beyond the construction sites during the construction period and buffer zones during the operation period.
Compared to the construction of the surface facilities, the construction and the further operation of traffic  tunnels  has  important  specific  features  that  influence  the  limit  and  the  result  of  the  detrimental  environmental impact.
(слайд 3)
Like it:
- simultaneous construction works on the ground surface and underground, which influences all the  biosphere  components (the  atmosphere,  the  soil,  the  surface  and  ground  water,  the  flora  and  the  fauna, and the population);
- use of a large variety of construction machines and equipment;
- considerable  duration  of  works,  which  can  last  up  to  5  years  with  a  temporary  change  in  the  detrimental impact limits;
(слайд 4)
In  the  course  of  observations for the construction of traffic tunnels at the combined road, simultaneous measurements of the thermodynamic and chemical parameters of the air in the tunnel excavations and at the construction sites were made, as well as the analyses of the chemical composition of the drainage and the waste water, and of the soil in the part of the road that are adjacent to the tunnel portals.

Assessment  of  the  traffic  tunnels  detrimental  environmental  impact  was  completed with the instrumental measurements of the pollutants concentration in the atmosphere and the soil during the operation period.
The  results  of  the  study  will  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  development  of  environmentally  friendly  construction  of  traffic  tunnels  under  similar conditions.

(слайд 5)
At the  initial  stage  of  construction,  the  pollutants(Сcarbon oxigen)  concentration  at  the  tunnel  portal  is  around  0–0.2 milligrams by cubic meter.  As  the  length  of  the  tunnel  increased,  an  increase  in  the  pollutants  concentration  was  observed  (up  to  5.0  milligrams by cubic meter),  which  may  be  explained  by  the  increase  in  the  amount  of  mining  and  conveyor  equipment  operating  in  the  tunnel  simultaneously.  The  drop  in  the  pollutants  concentration  occurred  after  the  creation  of  a  breakthrough  in  the  tunnel  and  after  the  completion  of  the main excavation works, as the result of the change in the ventilation system. (figure 1/2)
Before the creation of the breakthrough, the railroad and the motorroad tunnels were aired through plenum  ventilation  system.  After  the  breakthrough  connection  was  created  between  the  tunnel  sections  with  opposed  egresses,  in  the  central  part  of  the  tunnels  airway  stoppings  were  built,  divings  thus  the  tunnels into two separate parts, each of them aired through plenum ventilation.

During  the  motorroad  tunnel  construction  results  similar  to  those  of  the  railroad  tunnel  were  obtained. During the initial construction stage, a stronger environmental impact was observed. After the creation  of  a  breakthrough  and  the  completion  of  the  main  tunnel  excavation  works,  the  impact  decreased.
The described atmosphere environmental load dynamics may be explained by the increase in the amount  of  the  load-haul-dump  units  as  the  length  of  the  mined  tunnel  section grew  and,  consequently,  the pollutants dumping into the tunnel air intensified.

In conclusion,  the  analysis  of  the  monitoring  results  obtained  during  the  construction  period  demonstrated that in the course of traffic tunnels construction the environmental load, in particular that of the  atmosphere,  is  not  uniform.  The  environmental  load  is  minimal  at  the  initial  construction  period  and  increases  as  the  mined  tunnel  sections  grow  in  length  and  the  mining  works  intensify.  After  the  completion  of  the  main  construction  stage,  during  the  tunnel  equipping,  the  environmental  load  drops  again.
